<p class=MsoNormal><b>Computer Systems Development Services Inc. Master Service
Agreement</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This Master Service Agreement (&quot;MSA&quot; or this
&quot;Agreement&quot;) is entered into as of the date of the full execution
hereof on the last page, between Computer Systems Development Services Inc.
(&quot;MSP&quot;), and the client who has executed this Agreement on the last
page hereof (&quot;Client&quot;) and shall apply to all purchases by Client
from or through MSP of services (&quot;Services&quot;), as well as licenses for
software, hardware, support and maintenance services, and/or subscription
services (collectively, &quot;Products&quot;).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ENGAGEMENT</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Client hereby engages and retains MSP to render Services
and/or provide Products, as specifically set forth and limited in the
&quot;Proposal&quot; or &quot;Quote&quot; provided by MSP. A Proposal or Quote
becomes a binding &quot;Statement of Work&quot; (&quot;SOW&quot;) only upon
written or electronic signature by authorized representatives of both parties,
including any subsequent executed work orders or service tickets under any SOW.
Except as otherwise stated therein, subsequent SOWs shall be made a part of and
subject to the terms contained in this MSA. No Product or Services will be
provided as part of this Agreement without the execution of a written or
electronically executed SOW or other mutually acceptable documentation, each of
which must be executed by both parties hereto. Upon such execution, all terms
and conditions of this MSA shall for all purposes be deemed incorporated into
each SOW. In the event of any conflict between an SOW or Work Order and this
MSA, the MSA will control except where an SOW expressly identifies by section
number specific MSA provisions it is intended to override, provided that no SOW
may override the following core terms: payment obligations (Section 3),
confidentiality (Section 4), intellectual property (Section 10), limitation of
liability (Sections 18 and 19), termination (Section 5), or governing law and
jurisdiction (Section 26).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Client understands and acknowledges that MSP's pricing may
be subject to change during the term of the Agreement. Except as and to the
extent such price changes may be made on other terms and conditions contained
in Client's SOW, MSP will provide Client with thirty (30) days' prior written
notification of such price changes. Client may terminate the affected SOW upon
written notice if Client does not accept the price changes, with such
termination effective as of the date the price changes would otherwise take
effect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GENERAL REQUIREMENTS &amp; CONDITIONS</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System</b>. For the purposes of this Agreement,
&quot;System&quot; means, collectively, all computer network, computer system,
peripheral or device installed, maintained, monitored, or operated by MSP
pursuant to and further identified in a SOW with Client. To avoid a delay or
negative impact on our provision of the Services, during the term of each SOW
Client agrees to refrain from modifying or moving the System, or installing
software on the System, unless MSP expressly authorizes such activity in
writing. MSP will not be responsible or liable for changes made by client to
the System without MSP's authorization.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Updates</b>. If patches and other
software-related maintenance updates (&quot;Update(s)&quot;) are provided under
an SOW, MSP will install the Updates only if MSP has determined, in its
reasonable discretion, that the Updates will be compatible with the
configuration of the System and materially beneficial to the features or
functionality of the affected software. MSP will not be responsible or liable
for any downtime or losses arising from or related to the installation or use
of any Update, provided that the Update was installed by MSP in accordance with
the manufacturer or applicable vendor's instructions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third-Party Service Providers</b>.
&quot;Third-Party Service Providers&quot; means Services provided by an entity
or a party other than MSP in fulfillment of the SOW requirements whose terms
and conditions MSP and Client may be legally bound. MSP may, in its discretion,
utilize a Third-Party Service Provider to provide the Services hereunder. The
Third-Party Service Provider may require the MSP to sign or otherwise consent
to a contract with the Third-Party Service Provider for the Third-Party
Services (a &quot;Third-Party Contract&quot;) and the terms of the Third-Party
Contract may impose conditions and requirements upon Client, and may contain
reserved rights of the Third-Party Service Provider to change its pricing
during the term of the Third-Party Contract. Client's right to use the
Third-Party Services is subject to Client's compliance with and consent to the
terms and conditions of any Third-Party Contracts, which terms and conditions
MSP does not have authority to vary, alter or amend. Access to the terms and
conditions of any such Third- Party Contract(s) may be provided to Client or
appear on our website which identifies the Third- Party Service Provider and a
link to the Third-Party Contract or End User License Agreement
(&quot;EULA&quot;). Client acknowledges it is bound by all Third-Party
Contracts which MSP enters into on Client's behalf in connection with MSP's provision
of Products and Services hereunder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2.3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Third-Party Service Provider Links</b>. The
Third-Party Service Provider links below are being provided for convenience.
Client should monitor the links for the Third-Party Providers related to
Products and Services provided to Client hereunder to be certain Client has the
most current Terms and Conditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third-Party Products</b>. Unless otherwise
stated in an SOW, all hardware, software, peripherals or accessories purchased
through MSP (&quot;Third-Party Products&quot;) are nonrefundable once the
applicable SOW is placed in MSP's queue for delivery. The Third-Party Product
vendor may require the MSP to sign a contract with the Third-Party Product
vendor for its products (&quot;Third-Party Product Contract&quot;) and the
terms of the Third-Party Product Contract may impose certain conditions and
requirements upon Client and may contain reserved rights of the Third-Party
Service Provider to change its pricing during the term of the Third-Party
Product Contract. Access to the terms and conditions of any such Third-Party
Product Contract(s) will be provided to the Client or attached to the SOW which
identifies the Third-Party. Client hereby agrees to review all Third-Party
Contract terms and conditions, and consent to those Third-Party Product
Contracts with Third-Party Product vendors with whom Client has consented MSP
to contract on Client's behalf. MSP will use reasonable efforts to assign,
transfer and facilitate all warranties (if any) and service level commitments
(if any) provided by the Third-Party product vendor to Client, but will have no
liability whatsoever for the quality, functionality or operability of any
Third-Party Products, and MSP will not be responsible or liable for the
performance, uptime or usefulness of any Third-Party Products. Unless otherwise
expressly stated in a SOW, all Third-Party Products are provided &quot;as
is&quot; and without any warranty whatsoever as between MSP and Client (including
but not limited to implied warranties).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third-Party Support</b>. If, in MSP's
discretion, a hardware or software issue requires vendor or OEM support, MSP
may contact the vendor or OEM (as applicable) on Client's behalf and pass
through to Client all fees and costs incurred in that process. If such fees or
costs are anticipated in advance to exceed $100, MSP will obtain Client
permission before incurring such expenses on Client behalf unless exigent
circumstances require otherwise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subcontractors</b>. &quot;Subcontractors&quot;
means third parties with whom MSP contracts to provide specified services to
complete the services indicated in an SOW. MSP agrees to identify in Client's
SOW all Subcontractors MSP intends to use in connection with the Products and
Services provided to Client hereunder. If, during the course of the MSP's
provision of Products and Services hereunder, it determines it requires the
engagement of a Subcontractor not identified in an SOW, MSP will identify the
Subcontractor and the intended services the Subcontractor is to provide and
will give Client seven (7) days from and after that notice to object to the
engagement of that Subcontractor. Any objection by Client must be reasonable
and based on legitimate business concerns. Failure by Client to respond within
the seven (7) day period will be deemed consent to the engagement of the
Subcontractor. If Client reasonably objects to a Subcontractor, MSP agrees to
attempt to engage a replacement Subcontractor, and Client acknowledges that the
schedule and charges for such replacement Subcontractor may be on terms less
beneficial to Client. MSP will ensure that all Subcontractors are bound by
confidentiality and security obligations substantially similar to those set
forth in this Agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conditions of Service</b>. Client's System is
eligible for provision of MSP's Services as outlined in this Agreement and an
SOW only if the System is in good condition and MSP's following serviceability
requirements and site environmental conditions are met:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2.7.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Workspace Requirements</b>. Client shall provide
adequate workspace, heat, light, ventilation, electric current and outlets,

suspend or terminate this Agreement performance under this Agreement and any
SOW if, in its sole discretion, conditions at the service site pose a health or
safety threat to any of MSP's representatives.</p>

business hours are defined as Monday through Friday 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM Eastern
Time excluding U.S. holidays. Services requested outside of regular business
hours will be billed at a premium rate of one and one-half (1.5) times the
standard hourly rate unless the applicable SOW specifically includes 24x7
coverage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2.7.6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Service Locations</b>. MSP shall be obligated to
provide service only at (a) the Service Site(s) as identified in the SOW, and
(b) Client's Systems including Client's covered devices in any Remote
Monitoring Management (&quot;RMM&quot;) platform. If Client desires to
relocate, add or remove locations, Client shall give appropriate notice to MSP
of Client's intention to relocate no less than sixty (60) days in advance. MSP
reserves the right to renegotiate service terms with respect to any relocation
and/or addition of locations by Client. Such right includes the right to refuse
service at the relocation and/or new site.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2.7.7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Client Responsibilities</b>. Client agrees to
timely furnish, at Client's expense, all personnel, necessary computer

for purposes of MSP or its subcontractors, performing the Services. Client will
also provide MSP or its subcontractors, with access to all information,
passwords and facilities requested by MSP that is necessary for MSP or its
subcontractors, to perform the Services. Access may be denied for any reason at
any time, however if access to information, passwords or facilities is denied,
Client understands that MSP or its subcontractors may be unable to perform
their duties adequately, and Client will hold MSP harmless for any delays or
inability to perform Services directly caused by such denied access.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2.7.8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Change Control</b>. Any changes to the scope,
specifications, or deliverables set forth in an SOW that are requested by
Client must be documented in a written change order signed by both parties.
Such changes may result in adjustments to fees, timelines, and resource

without a properly executed change order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service Limitations</b>. In addition to other

are outside the scope of this Agreement. MSP will provide consultative
specification and sourcing guidance to Client, and/or Time and Material/Project

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2.8.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unauthorized Changes</b>. Any unauthorized
changes made to the System without MSP's written consent which causes issues or
failures to the System, are beyond the responsibility of MSP and Client will be
billed the full cost to restore the System to its original state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2.8.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Exclusive System Access</b>. Only
representatives authorized by MSP will be eligible to access and service the
System during the term of this Agreement and MSP is neither liable nor
responsible for any issues or failures of the System or Services resulting from
any unauthorized modification, installation, or service performed on the System
by individuals not employed or contracted by MSP. Any unauthorized access or
service conducted on the System, or the addition or connection of any
additional devices, hardware or systems of any kind to the System, without the
prior written consent of MSP is a breach of this Agreement. In the event of any
such unauthorized access, service or connections to the System, MSP may, at its
option, either: (a) remediate and restore the Systems and/or Services to a
state prior to the unauthorized changes and bill Client at MSP's then applicable
hourly labor rate(s) (in addition to all other charges under this Agreement and
the SOWs) for all Services and Products necessary and appropriate to resolve
and correct any negative System performance resulting therefrom or, (b)
terminate this Agreement and all SOWs upon written notice to Client.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2.8.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Infrastructure Failures</b>. MSP shall have no
responsibility for any failure or malfunction of electrical or
telecommunications infrastructure or services that causes damage to MSP's
Products or Services, nor shall MSP have any liability or responsibility for
any loss of Client data from any such failure or malfunction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2.9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Onboarding Process</b>. Client acknowledges and
agrees that MSP will have no responsibility for any deficiencies in the current
operating systems and infrastructure until the MSP has had a reasonable
opportunity to conduct a review of the current System, provide Client with its
recommendations, and Client has accepted and implemented such recommendations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2.10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offboarding Process</b>. In the event of
termination of Services by either party, MSP will make reasonable
accommodations to transfer Client's account to Client or Client's new managed
service provider or other authorized agent (the &quot;Onboarding
Provider&quot;). Client shall indemnify and hold harmless MSP, its
Subcontractors and their respective directors, officers, employees, consultants
and agents for any claims or losses resulting from the activities of Client or
the Onboarding Provider during the transition period from MSP to the Onboarding
Provider to the extent caused by Client or the Onboarding Provider, inclusive
of when Client obtains access to all super administrator accounts of their
infrastructure. Transfer will require that Client's account be fully paid at
time of transfer inclusive of any offboarding charges.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2.11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Network Devices, Hardware and Systems</b>. MSP
shall only be responsible for providing services to network devices, hardware
and systems identified by the Client and MSP and set forth in the agreed upon
System and RMM in the then most recent SOW. From time to time, SOWs will be
updated with new devices, hardware or systems that have been agreed upon by the
parties. If Client obtains new devices, hardware or systems and wishes to
request MSP's services to extend to new devices, hardware or systems, said
extension shall not take effect unless and until both Parties agree in writing
to a new SOW and the device is added to the RMM. Said written, signed SOW shall
then become an addendum to this contract and be incorporated herein. MSP
reserves the right to deny any requests for additional services and/or
additional hardware/systems for any reason in their sole discretion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2.12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Authorized Contact(s)</b>. Client understands
and agrees that MSP will be entitled to rely on any directions or consent
provided to MSP by any of the Client Authorized Contacts, as indicated in an
applicable SOW. Each SOW should identify specific named Authorized Contacts
with their email addresses. If no Authorized Contact is identified in an
applicable SOW, then Client Authorized Contact will be any person(s) (i) who
signed this Agreement, and/or (ii) who signed the applicable SOW. MSP may also
rely on communications from individuals using email addresses from Client's
corporate domain, provided such communications are confirmed by a named
Authorized Contact when requested by MSP. Client is responsible for ensuring
that only authorized individuals execute SOWs or Work Orders on Client's behalf
and acknowledges its duty to have internal policies and procedures in effect to
control such authority. If Client desires to change Client Authorized
Contact(s), Client shall notify MSP of such changes in writing which, unless
exigent circumstances are stated in the notice, will take effect three (3)
business days thereafter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PAYMENT TERMS</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Invoicing</b>. Unless otherwise specified in an
SOW, MSP will invoice Client monthly in advance for recurring services and
weekly in arrears for time and materials services. One-time charges for
products or project work will be invoiced upon delivery or completion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Payment Due Date</b>. All invoices are due and
payable within thirty (30) days of the invoice date (&quot;Net 30&quot;). Time
is of the essence with respect to payment obligations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late Fees and Interest</b>. Past due amounts
will accrue interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month
or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less. In addition to
interest, MSP may assess a late fee of fifty dollars ($50) for each invoice
that remains unpaid after the due date.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disputed Charges</b>. Client must notify MSP in
writing of any disputed charges within fifteen (15) days of the invoice date.
Undisputed portions of any invoice must be paid when due. MSP will work in good
faith to resolve any disputed charges within thirty (30) days of receipt of
Client's dispute notice. For time and materials charges, MSP will provide
reasonable supporting documentation including timesheets upon Client's request
for disputed invoice items.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suspension for Nonpayment</b>. If Client fails
to pay any undisputed amounts when due, MSP may, upon five (5) business days'
written notice, suspend performance of Services until all outstanding amounts
are paid. Such suspension will not relieve Client of its payment obligations,
and MSP will not be liable for any damages resulting from such suspension. MSP
may also terminate this Agreement and any SOWs for material breach if payment
is not received within thirty (30) days after the suspension notice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONFIDENTIALITY &amp; NON-DISCLOSURE</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confidential Information Definition</b>. As
used herein, &quot;Confidential Information&quot; means all information
disclosed by a Party (&quot;Disclosing Party&quot;) to the other Party
(&quot;Receiving Party&quot;), in any format whether oral, written, electronic,
or other, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be
understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the
circumstances of disclosure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Client Confidential Information</b>. Client
Confidential Information shall include any personally identifiable information
or protected health information of Client employees, Client customers, and
Client data. Client acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement does not
constitute a Business Associates Agreement (&quot;BAA&quot;) as that term is defined
in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA; Public Law
104-191, 110 Stat. 1936, enacted August 21, 1996 and as amended), and that such
an agreement in addition to this Agreement may be necessary to provide the
Services hereunder. Client shall be solely responsible for the consequences, if
any, of moving forward with the Services hereunder without such a BAA and shall
be solely responsible for determining the necessity of a BAA in addition to
this Agreement. Client hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless MSP
and any affiliated company, and MSP's respective present and former
shareholders, officers, directors and employees and our attorneys and agents,
and our predecessors, successors, insurers, assigns, heirs, executors and
administrators (collectively referred to as the &quot;Indemnitees&quot;), from
and against any and all claims, demands, causes of action, actions, judgments,
liabilities, losses, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and costs,
as they occur, brought against, imposed upon, or incurred or suffered by, the
Indemnitees which in any way relate to the failure of Client to comply with
applicable law and regulations as to the proper handling of protected health
information, the absence of any necessary BAA, or failing to notify MSP of the
necessity of same.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confidential Information Scope</b>.
Confidential Information of each Party shall include, without limitation, the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, and all SOWs, and/or other contract

obligation owed to the Disclosing Party,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4.4.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Third-Party Receipt</b>. is received from a
Third-Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4.4.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Independent Development</b>. was independently
developed by the Receiving Party.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protection of Confidential Information</b>. The
Receiving Party shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4.5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard of Care</b>. protect and safeguard the
confidentiality of all Confidential Information with at least the same degree
of care as the Receiving Party would protect its own Confidential Information,
but in no event with less than a commercially reasonable degree of care,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4.5.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use Limitations</b>. not use any Confidential
Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose outside the scope of this
Agreement or otherwise in any manner to the Disclosing Party's detriment, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4.5.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Access Limitations</b>. except as otherwise
authorized by the Disclosing Party in writing, limit access to Confidential
Information of the Disclosing Party to those of its and its Affiliates'
employees, subcontractors and agents who need such access for purposes
consistent with this Agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Court Orders and Compelled Disclosure</b>.
Nothing herein shall prevent disclosure of Confidential Information if required
by law, court order, or government regulation, provided that the Receiving
Party gives the Disclosing Party prompt written notice of such requirement to
allow the Disclosing Party to seek protective orders or other appropriate
relief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Return and Destruction</b>. Upon termination of
this Agreement or upon written request by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving
Party shall promptly return or destroy all documents, materials, and other
tangible manifestations of Confidential Information and certify in writing that
such return or destruction has been completed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Injunctive Relief</b>. The parties acknowledge
that breach of this confidentiality provision would cause irreparable harm for
which monetary damages would be inadequate. Therefore, the non-breaching party
shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief and other equitable remedies
without the requirement of posting a bond.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4.9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protected Health Information</b>. MSP is not
obligated to handle Protected Health Information (&quot;PHI&quot;) as defined
under HIPAA unless a separate Business Associate Agreement (&quot;BAA&quot;) is
executed between the parties. MSP will not knowingly accept, process, or store
PHI without a properly executed BAA in place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMINATION</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Termination for Convenience</b>. Either party
may terminate this Agreement or any SOW for convenience upon sixty (60) days'
written notice to the other party. However, if Client terminates this Agreement
or any SOW for convenience, Client shall pay MSP a termination penalty equal to
fifty percent (50%) of the remaining fees that would have been due under the
terminated Agreement or SOW for the lesser of: (a) twelve (12) months from the
effective date of termination, or (b) the remaining term of the Agreement or
SOW. This penalty is in addition to all charges incurred through the effective
date of termination and represents the parties' reasonable estimate of MSP's

assets, including computer hardware and/or software, in connection with MSP
providing the Services, all such assets will remain the sole property of MSP,
except that assets sold by MSP to Client or procured by MSP on Client's behalf
shall be the sole property of Client. Client will take such reasonable
precautions to ensure the quality, completeness and workmanship of any item or
equipment or hardware furnished by Client, and for ensuring that the materials

any third-party.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>8.1.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless Client purchases Backup Services as
expressly specified in an SOW, MSP does not provide any type of backup of
Client data, and Client shall be responsible for maintaining adequate backup
for all data and other items furnished to MSP. If Client purchases Backup
Services per an SOW, MSP will perform backups according to the Backup Schedule
and specifications set forth in such SOW, but Client remains responsible for
testing backup integrity and maintaining additional backup copies as Client
deems appropriate for its business continuity requirements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CLIENT DATA OWNERSHIP AND RESPONSIBILITY</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>9.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Client shall have sole responsibility for
the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and
intellectual property ownership or right to use of any data, information or

<p class=MsoNormal><b>9.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Client-Provided Materials Warranty</b>. Client

property rights, and (d) does not contain any malicious code, viruses, or other
harmful components. Client shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless MSP from
any claims, damages, or expenses arising from Client's breach of these
warranties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>10.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Background Intellectual Property</b>. MSP
retains all intellectual property rights in any technology, methodologies,
processes, software, and know-how that: (a) MSP owned or developed prior to
this Agreement, (b) MSP develops independently of this Agreement, or (c)
constitutes MSP's general knowledge, skills, experience, and techniques
(&quot;Background IP&quot;). Client acquires no right or interest in Background
IP by virtue of this Agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>10.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work Product</b>. Subject to MSP's retained
rights in Background IP and Third-Party IP, Client shall own all work product,
deliverables, and materials created specifically for Client under this
Agreement and paid for in full by Client (&quot;Work Product&quot;). MSP
retains a perpetual, non-exclusive license to use generalized methods,
techniques, and know-how developed during the performance of Services for its
business purposes, provided such use does not disclose Client's Confidential
Information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>10.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third-Party Intellectual Property</b>. Client
acknowledges that the Services may incorporate third-party software, materials,
or intellectual property (&quot;Third-Party IP&quot;). Client's rights to
Third-Party IP are subject to the applicable third-party license terms and
Client shall comply with all such terms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>10.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License Restrictions</b>. Client may not
disassemble or reverse engineer any Background IP or Third-Party IP or
decompile or otherwise attempt to derive any software source code, except to
the extent expressly permitted by applicable law despite this limitation.

evaluation, or benchmarking or performance tests on MSP's Background IP without
MSP's prior written approval.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>10.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open-Source Software</b>. If any deliverables or
Work Product include open-source software components, MSP will identify such
components and their applicable licenses. Client's use of such components will

<p class=MsoNormal><b>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LICENSE AGREEMENTS</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>11.1.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License. Subject to this Agreement, MSP
grants Client a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use all
programming, documentation, reports, and any other product provided as part of
the Services solely for Client's own internal use. At all times, all software
on the System must be genuine and licensed, and Client agrees to provide MSP
with proof of such licensing upon request. If MSP requires Client to implement
certain minimum hardware or software requirements (&quot;Minimum
Requirements&quot;), Client agrees to do so as an ongoing requirement of MSP
providing its Services to Client.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>11.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Software Installation or Replication</b>. If MSP
is required to install or replicate Client software as part of the Services,
Client will independently verify that all such software is properly licensed.
Client's provision of any software to MSP will be deemed Client's affirmative
representation to MSP that Client has a valid license that permits MSP to
perform the Services related thereto. In addition, Client shall be responsible
for monitoring Client equipment for the installation of unlicensed software
unless MSP in a written SOW expressly agrees to conduct such monitoring. Client
will indemnify and hold harmless MSP against all damages and expenses MSP may
incur (including reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements) related to
Client providing infringing unlicensed materials to MSP in violation of this
Section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>11.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pre-Existing License Agreements</b>. Any
software product provided to Client by MSP as a reseller for a third-party,
which is licensed to Client under a separate software license agreement with
such third-party, will continue to be governed by the third-party license
agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>11.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End User License Agreements</b>. Portions of the
Services may require Client to accept the terms of one or more third-party end
user license agreements (&quot;EULAs&quot;). If the acceptance of a EULA is
required to provide the Services to Client, then Client hereby grants MSP
permission to accept the EULA on Client behalf. EULAs may contain service
levels, warranties and/or liability limitations that are different than those
contained in this Agreement. Client agrees to be bound by the terms of such
EULAs and will look only to the applicable third-party provider for the
enforcement of the terms of such EULAs. If, while providing the Services, MSP
is required to comply with a third-party EULA and the third-party EULA is
modified or amended in a way that materially affects fees or Client's material
rights, MSP will notify Client of such changes and may adjust SOW rates
accordingly or, if the changes are unacceptable to either party, either party
may terminate the affected portion of the SOW upon written notice. Client
agrees to hold harmless and indemnify MSP against Client violation of any of
the terms and conditions included in the subject EULA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RESTRICTIONS AS TO MSP'S EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR
SUBCONTRACTORS</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>12.1.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Client acknowledges that MSP has incurred
substantial recruitment, screening, training, and administrative expenses with
respect to its agents, including its employees, vendors and independent
subcontractors. From the Effective Date of the last SOW and up to one (1)
calendar year after the date of termination of any SOW, Client shall not
directly or indirectly solicit, recruit, hire, or contract with any of MSP's
employees, agents or subcontractors who have communicated with and/or worked on
any Service for Client. For purposes of this Section, &quot;solicit&quot; does
not include general job postings or advertisements not specifically targeted at
MSP personnel, or hiring individuals who respond to such general postings
without any direct or indirect solicitation. Client and MSP mutually
acknowledge and agree that it would be impractical and extremely difficult to
ascertain the amount of monetary damages that would be caused by a breach by
Client of this provision. Therefore, Client and MSP mutually agree that in the
event of a breach by Client in any way of this provision, Client shall pay to
MSP as liquidated damages, an amount equal to the greater of: (a) One Hundred
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000.00), or (b) fifty percent (50%) of the total
compensation paid by MSP to such employee, agent, or subcontractor in the
twelve (12) months immediately preceding the breach. This amount represents the
parties' reasonable attempt to assess the damages MSP would suffer as a direct
result of such breach, considering: (i) the average revenue generated by MSP
employees over extended employment periods; (ii) MSP's substantial costs in
recruiting, training, and replacing such personnel; (iii) the uncertainty of
successfully replacing specialized personnel; and (iv) the practical
impossibility of accurately quantifying such losses at the time of breach.
Nothing in this paragraph shall limit MSP's rights to obtain injunctive relief
or pursue any other legal remedies available at law or equity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LIMITED EXCLUSIVE WARRANTY</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>13.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Performance Warranty</b>. MSP warrants that it
and its Subcontractors will perform the Services substantially in accordance
with the specifications set forth in this Agreement, SOWs, and/or other written
agreements between the Parties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>13.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Claims Window and Notice</b>. For any claimed
breach of the foregoing warranty, Client shall provide MSP written notice of
the claim, specifying in reasonable detail such claim of non-conformance,
within thirty (30) days of Client's discovery of the claimed breach but in no
event more than thirty (30) days after delivery or completion of the applicable
Services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>13.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exclusive Remedies</b>. MSP, or its contracted
subcontractors, will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to re-perform any
non-conforming services. If MSP concludes that conformance is impracticable,
then MSP will refund the fees paid by Client to MSP that are directly allocable
to such non-conforming Services only (not the entire SOW). The re-performance
of services or refund of the directly allocable fees provided in this Section
shall be Client's sole and exclusive remedies regarding such warranty claims.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>13.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warranty Limitations</b>. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary in this Agreement, any warranty offered and provided
directly by MSP shall be deemed null and void if the applicable product or
service is (i) altered, modified or repaired by persons other than MSP,
including, without limitation, the installation of any attachments, features,
or devices not supplied or approved by MSP (ii) misused, abused, or not
operated in accordance with the specifications of MSP or the applicable
manufacturer or creator of the hardware or product, or, (iii) subjected to
improper site preparation or maintenance, repair or replacement by persons
other than MSP or persons approved or designated by MSP.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>13.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disclaimer of Other Warranties</b>. EXCEPT FOR

&quot;BETA&quot;) RELEASES OF SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED TO CLIENT, SUCH COPIES ARE
PROVIDED &quot;AS-IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CLIENT CYBER SECURITY</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>14.1.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MSP does not provide any type of internet
security monitoring, cyber security monitoring, cyber terrorism monitoring, or
other cyber threats for Client except as, and only to the extent, expressly
specified in the SOW. As cyber threats are always evolving it is strongly
recommended that Client directly engage the services of a cyber protection
third-party vendor to monitor the cyber controls and cyber activities in Client
System. If Client purchases cybersecurity services including but not limited to
endpoint detection and response (EDR), backup services, or security information
and event management (SIEM), the service level agreements, response windows,
and performance metrics for such services shall be defined exclusively in the
applicable SOW.</p>

warrants that it will comply with all applicable laws and regulations,
including but not limited to data protection, export control, and
anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the
UK Bribery Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>15.2.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The software, Products and Services provided
by MSP are not intended or warranted to bring Client into regulatory compliance
with any rule, regulation, local, state or national law, standard or
requirement. The software, Services Products, and solutions provided hereunder
may aid Client's efforts to such achieve regulatory compliance, however, MSP
does not provide comprehensive compliance analysis and solutions. Client
acknowledges and agrees that it is solely responsible for compliance with all
applicable export control laws and regulations, including but not limited to
the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the International Traffic in
Arms Regulations (ITAR), and all applicable economic sanctions programs. Client
represents that it will not use the Services or Products in violation of any
anti-corruption laws, including but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA) and the UK Bribery Act.</p>

form of cyberattack, any loss of personally identifiable or protected
information, goodwill, use, market reputation, business receipts or contracts

unsolicited email, direct mail, facsimiles, unsolicited text messages, voice
calls, telemarketing or because of the collection of information by means of
any form of electronic malware, wiretapping, bugging, video cameras or
identification tags.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>20.1.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MSP agrees to maintain sufficient insurance
coverage, as and to the extent such coverage is available on commercially
